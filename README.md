# Blockchain implementation

## What has been done:
* Created own blockchain
* Understood how hashing works in maintaining integrity of the blockchain
* Saw how new blocks get added
* Viewed blockchain in a web browser
* Wrote new blocks
* Got a foundational understanding of the blockchain
<!-- * Saw how tiebreakers get resolved when multiple nodes generate blocks -->

## What **hasn't** been done

* To keep this simple, I didn't deal with more advanced consensus concepts like proof of work or proof of stake.
* Network interactions are simulated so I can view blockchain and see blocks added, but network broadcasting is not done.

## Technology
* Golang
* GraphQL

## Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NavenduDuari/go-blockchain
cd go-blockchain
go run main.go
```
